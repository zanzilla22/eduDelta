============================================================

    This model allows you to learn the function of motion-sync, which can achieve realistic lip-sync.
    The parameter structure corresponds to the default preset for lip-sync, so it can be used as a reference for how to create the mouth.
    A model file is provided for each of preset.
    You can try out the motion-sync function with the included audio file.
